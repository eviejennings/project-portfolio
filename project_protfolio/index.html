        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I recently completed a Digital Marketing apprenticeship. Throughout
          this apprenticeship, I found my love for web design, which eventually
          turned into a love for web development. I have now been developing
          websites for almost a year and am loving the learning process.

              ><h3>Schiaparelli Website</h3></a
            >
            <p>
              I built this site as part of an online coding course with
              SheCodes. We were given the freedom to create a website on any
              topic we wanted to display and practice our skills. I really
              enjoyed playing around with CSS in this project.

              ><h3>Weather App Website</h3></a
            >
            <p>
              This was a very challenging project, aslo with SheCodes, that
              revolved more around JavaScript. It was very rewarding to see my
              final project!

        <h3>Disso Website</h3>
        <p>
          I created this project using WebFlow when working for this companies
          marketing team. What I loved about this project was the simplicity of
          their style guide and how sleek I could make the website look. <br />
          I also learnt a lot about making a website more accessible and
          utilising SEO techniques.

        <h3>Martial Arts Website</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoyed working with the interactivness of this website and the idea
          of displaying a mobile app on a website was new to me.
